# SloppyOS
Well, it's an OS, and it's sloppy.

## So, how did we get here?
I find operating systems fascinating. The technology behind them, from boot sectors to kernels, intrigues me. I want to build my own operating system, and this is my initial, albeit "sloppy", attempt.

## Plans
I think I'll eventually move away from writing my own boot sector. Once I've ironed out its issues, I might just switch to GRUB or something similar. As for the kernel, I'm undecided. While I could use Linux, I'm excited about the prospect of crafting my own, even if it's just for fun. Later on, I might transition to a more established one.
